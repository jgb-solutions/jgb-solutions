👋 About me

I’m a full‑stack developer focused on shipping real products, keeping systems fast, and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

I enjoy working close to the metal when it matters (performance, infra, data flow) and higher‑level tooling when it accelerates delivery.
	•	🧠 Strong bias toward performance and simplicity
	•	🛠️ Comfortable across frontend, backend, and infrastructure
	•	🚀 Prefer tools that scale without becoming fragile
