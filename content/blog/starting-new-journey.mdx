Hi, Welcome to my very personal website! The name is Jean Gérard Bousiquot by the way. I am a software developer and a young entrepreneur based in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

This website is home to my personal rants, thoughts and other random stuff that way or may not be related to tech. I will mostly post about tech stuff, because that's where I spend most of my time, but here and there will be some other topics as well. I've always wanted to write more about what interests me, but each time I started I quickly lost the motivation. Mostly because I find myself doing many other things rather than writing. And I believe in writing. A lot. Mainly because I read a lot. Everyday. I just love to read. I love more knowledge. Sometimes I just procrastinate from real work just for the sake of reading. And I've known for a while that writing is one of those skills that develop one's mind in different ways, for the better.

I like to create things. I like to play with new shiny languages, frameworks and libraries when I stumble upon them. And sometimes I create new things with them. For example this very website is built with Strapi and Next.js. Strapi is a headless CMS (Content Management System) and I wanted to get my hands dirty and build something with it, as little as it could be, That rather simple website has allowed me to explore Strapi and found many ways to use in different types of websites and applications. That's I how got to learn many of those tools. And I don't plan to stop anytime soon.

One other interesting aspect of writing for me is to allow me to document stuff I'm working on, problems I find and how I solve them. Or maybe just a few tips and tricks to do something smarter or just quickly. I'm planning to write more about Elixir, Phoenix, Next.js, React and many more.

I won't make the first post any longer than it already is. If you are reading this, just know that I will post something new once or twice every 2 weeks. There will be at least a share button for Twitter and Facebook. Anyway that's my plan for now. See you soon!
