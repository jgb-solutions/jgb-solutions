Talking.
We've been doing it since we learned to.
It's one of those things that are so common people tend to forget how useful they are.
Yet when one cannot do so naturally, they are marked as being disabled.
We communicate the good or the bad, express ourselves, sing, scream, and even cry.
One uses their voice to do all these things, so technically they are talking, maybe not in the most natural way, but they do.
Either for joy, sadness or just simply to function normally as a living human being.

What if we take a step back and talk less? Maybe that ability is not useful everytime.
When we do it, we can hurt, heal, make people understand or misunderstand us.
So what to do? What is it going to be? Here's my take on this.
I've decided for a few a years that I would be talking less and listen more.
Not to have more control as the title implies, but to understand more, to get the meaning of my existence.
But as one of the consequences of doing it less, I got more control of my life, existence and my surroundings.
I also got to understanding and be knowledgeable when I'm not in control.
Talking less can give you the ability to understand what people are not saying verbally.
Because they can talk in other ways rather than using their voice.
They can talk with a gesture, their behavior, or an action.
And still they may never say a word.
You gain more knowledge by listening more.
You may probably not be the smartest or the most knowledgeable person in the room and that's one more reason to listen.
Talking less can and will get you in less trouble throughout your lifetime.
It worked and still works for me.

The realization of my ignorance made me decide to talk less.
Less of my thoughts, less of my life, less of my struggles, less of my worries.
It's not always the right thing to do, but it's done more good than bad until now, so I'll keep my mouth shut more, unless I really need to or they ask me too.
