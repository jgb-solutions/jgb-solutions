## Project Overview

En Avant is a political movement in Haiti founded by Jerry Tardieu with the goal of bringing change through unity and a structured national project. The website serves as the central hub for the movement, providing information about its leaders, mission ("Nos Combats"), and organizational structure. It also serves as a news portal and a platform for members to join or donate.

## The Challenge

The movement needed a robust, scalable, and easy-to-manage platform to reach a wide audience, including the Haitian diaspora. Key challenges included:

- **Dynamic Content:** Needing frequent updates for news and press releases.
- **Performance:** Ensuring fast load times for users in Haiti and abroad.
- **Content Management:** Allowing non-technical staff to update content easily.

## The Solution

We implemented a **Headless CMS** architecture to solve these challenges.

- **Frontend:** Built with **Next.js** to ensure high performance through server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **Backend:** Leveraged **WordPress** as a headless CMS via its JSON API. This allows the content team to use the familiar WordPress dashboard for editing posts and pages without touching the code.
- **UI/UX:** Utilized **React Bootstrap** and **Material UI** to create a responsive, modern, and accessible interface that reflects the movement's professional and forward-looking brand.
