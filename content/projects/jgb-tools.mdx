## Project Overview

JGB Tools is a suite of privacy-friendly, free online utilities designed to solve common digital problems without the clutter of ads or tracking scripts. It offers "Simple Tools That Just Work."

## The Challenge

The internet is flooded with "free" tool websites that are often slow, ridden with invasive ads, and track user data aggressively. Finding a simple, clean, and trustworthy utility for tasks like messaging a non-contact on WhatsApp or checking if a site is down can be surprisingly frustrating.

## The Solution

JGB Tools provides a clean, fast, and private alternative. Built with a modern tech stack including TanStack Start and PocketBase, it delivers a seamless user experience. Key tools include:

- **WhatsApp Anyone:** Message any number without saving it to your contacts first.
- **Is It Down?:** Instantly check website availability for everyone, not just you.

The platform prioritizes user privacy with a strict "No ads, No tracking, No nonsense" policy.
