## Project Overview

JC Cantave is a premier provider of aerial photography, drone videography, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) services in Haiti. The platform serves as a professional showcase for high-quality imagery and a gateway for clients to request specialized surveying and mapping services.

## The Challenge

The client needed a digital presence that matched the high precision and artistic quality of their work. The website required the ability to display high-resolution galleries without compromising performance, while also effectively communicating complex technical services like GIS mapping to potential business clients.

## The Solution

We developed a high-performance, visually stunning website using **React** and **TanStack Start**.

- **Content Management:** Integrated **Strapi CMS** to allow the client to easily update portfolios and service offerings.
- **UI/UX:** Utilized **Shadcn UI** components for a polished, professional look that builds trust with enterprise clients.
- **Performance:** Optimized image loading strategies ensure that even image-heavy gallery pages load instantly.
