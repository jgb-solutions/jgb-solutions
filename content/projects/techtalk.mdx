## Project Overview

Tech Talk is a dedicated platform aimed at empowering the Haitian community through technology. It serves as a hub for the "Tech Talk" podcast, articles, and community discussions, bridging the gap between local talent and global tech trends.

## The Challenge

The Haitian tech community lacked a centralized, high-quality platform to consume relevant content, network, and share ideas. Existing solutions were fragmented. The goal was to build a unified space that was accessible, fast, and engaging for a growing audience of developers and tech enthusiasts.

## The Solution

We launched a dynamic media platform built with **React** and **TanStack Start**.

- **Modern Architecture:** The site leverages modern web standards to deliver podcast episodes and articles with zero latency.
- **Community Focus:** Designed with a clean, content-first aesthetic using **Tailwind CSS** to keep the focus on the discussions that matter.
- **Scalability:** The architecture is ready to support future features like community forums and live event streaming.
