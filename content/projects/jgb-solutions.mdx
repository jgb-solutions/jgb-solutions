## Project Overview

This website serves as the digital headquarters for JGB Solutions. It is a comprehensive portfolio designed to showcase software engineering expertise, share technical insights through a blog, and provide a direct channel for potential clients and collaborators.

## The Challenge

In a crowded digital landscape, standing out as a senior software engineer requires more than just a LinkedIn profile. The challenge was to create a personal brand platform that reflects technical depth, attention to detail, and a commitment to modern web standards—all while being blazing fast and SEO-optimized.

## The Solution

We architected a cutting-edge portfolio using **TanStack Start**, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) for optimal performance and SEO.

- **Stack:** Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a type-safe, utility-first styling approach.
- **Design:** Features a sleek, dark-mode compatible UI with smooth animations and a "glassmorphism" aesthetic.
- **Content:** Integrated a markdown-based content system for easy project and blog management.
