## Project Overview

MP3PAM is a premier Haitian entertainment platform dedicated to sharing all kinds of audio content. From the latest music tracks to engaging podcasts and even advertisements, MP3PAM serves as a central hub for audio distribution.

## The Challenge

Content creators and artists needed a reliable, free platform to distribute their audio content to a wide audience without restrictive barriers. Users wanted a unified place to discover, listen to, and download unlimited sounds seamlessly across devices.

## The Solution

We built a robust, scalable web application using SvelteKit and PocketBase. The platform features:

- **Unlimited Sharing:** Users can upload and share music and podcasts without limits.
- **High Performance:** Powered by SvelteKit and Cloudflare R2 for fast content delivery.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive interface built with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS ensuring a great experience on both mobile and desktop.
