# TanStack Start Development Skill

This skill provides resources and guidelines for building applications with TanStack Start.

## Resources

- [LLM Optimization Guide](ref_tanstack_start_llmo.md): Guidelines for structuring content for LLMs, using structured data, and server functions.
- [Quick Start Guide](ref_tanstack_start_quick_start.md): Quick start examples and deployment instructions.

## Key Concepts

- **Server Functions**: Use `createServerFn` for server-side logic and API interactions.
- **File-Based Routing**: Routes are defined in `src/routes`.
- **Vite Integration**: Uses Vite for building and development (no longer Vinxi).
- **LLM Optimization**: Use structured data (JSON-LD) and clear content hierarchy.
